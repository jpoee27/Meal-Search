User interface created with React JS and Tailwind CSS to search for meals using Edamam Recipe Search API. 

Meal Search will fetch meals from Edamam Recipe Search API, and will return ten meals closest related to the term entered by the user in the search field. 

The user can sort through the ten meals returned using the select input labeled "Sort Meals By". The sort input will then sort the meals returned based on the sort type entered by the user.
